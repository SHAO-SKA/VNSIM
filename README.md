## :sparkles: VNSIM :sparkles:

I am trying to develop an integrated VLBI simulator, named **VNSIM**, for the VLBI research community. This work is initially motivated by the demand of the East Asia VLBI Networks and can also be expandable to other VLBI networks and generic interferometers. 

VNSIM aims to assist radio astronomers to design, evaluate and simulate the VLBI experiments in a more friendly, flexible, and convenient fashion. It not only integrates the functionality of plotting (u, v) coverage, scheduling the observation, and displaying the dirty and CLEAN images, but also further extends to add new features such as the sensitivity calculation of a certain network and multiple-satellite space VLBI simulations. To facilitate the use for new astronomers, VNSIM provides flexible interactions on both command line and graphical user interface and offers friendly support for log report and database management. 

In addition to the source code, there are some other materials that can help you better get started.
 
- The documentation about the installation and user guidance was provided at the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/ZhenZHAO/VNSIM/wiki).

- The paper entitled, "[VLBI Network SIMulator: An Integrated Simulation Tool for Radio Astronomers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06726v1)", has briefly presented this work with some demonstrations.  

- My personal development process was specified in the [Project page](https://github.com/ZhenZHAO/VNSIM/projects/1). New developing plans will be listed there if any.

- If you came across any problems, please post your questions at hte [Issue Tag](https://github.com/ZhenZHAO/VNSIM/issues). I will leave my responses asap.
